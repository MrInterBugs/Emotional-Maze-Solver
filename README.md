# Emotional-Maze-Solver
### CS1822 LeJOS Robotics Project.
For our project we are creating a maze solving robot that will have different behaviours based on NFC tags.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
You must have [LeJOS](http://www.lejos.org) installed. As well as the [Eclipse](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9954-lejos-plugin-for-lego-ev3-mindstorms) plugin or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9954-lejos-plugin-for-lego-ev3-mindstorms) plugin.\
You will also need the [Android app](https://github.com/cyclingProfessor/EV3Sensors) and OpenCV manager 3.43 found [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-android/3.4.3/).
### Installing
Clone this repository and open with java IDE. If the plugin is installed just click run and the Executable jar will be copied across to the robot.\
If you do not want to install the plugin [click here](http://www.lejos.org/nxt/nxj/tutorial/Preliminaries/CompileAndRun.htm) to see other ways of compiling it.
